# Acknowledgements

I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. Regarding PyViz and the visualization process overall I utilized information from Holoviews.com, hvplot.holoviz.org, geeks for geeks.org, towardsdatascience.com, and the tech website collective in general. Finally, regarding Python and pandas,  "Python Data Science Handbook" by Jake VanderPlas was as always helpful, the Pandas documentation website and other sites like Data Science Parichay, as I continued my learning process.
