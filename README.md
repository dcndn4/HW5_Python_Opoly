I would like to first acknowledge the guidance and teaching of our FinTech Boot Camp Instructor, Garth Mortensen, our TA, Alejandro Esquivel, and out Student Success Manager, Angelica Baraona. I also found the collective Stack Overflow wisdom essential as ever. Regarding PyViz and the visualization process overall I utilized information from Holoviews.com and the tech website collective in general. Finally, the Python books were helpful as I continued my learning process.
